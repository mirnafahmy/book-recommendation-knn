# book-recommendation-knn

A book recommendation algorithm using K-Nearest Neighbors. Since the Nearest Neighbors method uses distance to measure how "close" two instances are to one another, it will be able to display books that are similar to a specific book. A function called get_recommends will be used, which accepts a book title from the dataset as an argument and outputs a list of 5 books that are relevant to the book argument, along with their distances from it.

The Book Crossings dataset will be utilized. This dataset contains 1.1 million ratings (on a scale of 0-10) of 270,000 books by 90,000 users.
